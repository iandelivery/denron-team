## About me

I grew up in an apple orchard and like planting apples.

## How you can help me

Letting me know when I am talking about apples to much

## My working style

I like working with an apple in hand. Also, I do better with written instructions over meetings.

## What I assume about others

I assume people like apples and will bring extra with me. I also assume that we are all trying to learn from one another and will assume good intent. 

## Communicating with me

Email is the best way of reaching me as I'm usually not online otherwise. 

## Strengths

I know everything about apples. 
I can tell you how react works inside and out.

## Weaknesses

Its hard for me to work on projects without constraints. I like having detailed specs for the things I work on.
